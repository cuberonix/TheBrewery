	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<div id = "fadein">
<p>
The idea for The Brewery started six years ago, in 2011. 
</br>
</br>
It was as simple as "Hey, we enjoy trying different beers, why don't we create our own?". And from there, The Brewery was born. We are a grassroots craft brewer based in Ontario that aims to fuse the creativity of craft beer into something tasty and refreshing. Here at The Brewery we believe in two things: The first is that creativity fosters great ideas. And the second is that great ideas yield delicious pints.
</br>
</br>
As we grow, we keep learning a lot about ourselves and our customers, too. Our small team is constantly trying to do something different to set us apart from the crowd. We like to "wow" our customers. That's why each of our beers is a work of art. We proudly brew some of the most well-crafted beers in the area with the help of our brewmasters. We also like to think they're some of the best tasting beers we've ever had, and we hope you'll agree!
