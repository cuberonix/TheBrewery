<h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
</br>

<div id ="fadein">
	<h3>How is your beer made? </h3>
	<p>
		The German Beer Law of 1516 says that beer should only contain barley, hops, yeast and water. These are the building blocks of beer. Many German and Belgian beers also contain wheat and mass produced beer can contain Corn. Seasonal and specialty brews may also contain additional fruits, grains or ingredients that vary from this list. Aside from this, we have our own special grains and malts that we add in. But unfortunately, that's a secret!
	</p>
</br>
	<h3> How long does it take to come up with a new product? </h3>

	<p>
		There is no set time for how long it takes to come up with a product. Generally, we come up with at least three or four good ideas a year. We will then take one of those ideas and try to produce something from it. Sometimes it works out and we can make it into an actual product. Other times, it may resemble one of our other products too closely, or it just plain isn't good enough. When we come out with a new brew, know that it has been through lots of testing!
	</p>
</br>
	<h3>Is beer actually good for your health?</h3>

	<p>
		To a degree, yes. When consumed in moderation it has been proven that beer can lead to improved health. Beer has been shown to help fight disease, increase the body’s levels of antioxidants, help prevent cancer, reduce menopausal hot flashes and fight off osteoporosis. Plus it's nutritious!
